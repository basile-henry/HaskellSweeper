# Todo list
- (DONE) Infinite grid in all directions
- (DONE) When opening empty cells stop at the edge of the terminal (and update on move/resize)
- (DONE) Mark cells with mine markers (â–²) -- toggleable with a key (say "M"), when marked the cell cannot be opened
- (DONE) problem when resizing terminal too small: it breaks ncurses and exits
- when the number of markers matches the current cell's number: possibility to open neighbouring cells
- when mine explodes: ripple explode through the whole terminal
- stop the cursor from blinking
- possiblity to position the cursor not in the center (maybe with a margin of 5 cells to the sides)
- UI colors/characters
- Adventure mode
- Power ups?
- Add sounds?
